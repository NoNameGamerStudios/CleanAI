The G. & C. Merriam Co., founded in 1831, acquired the rights after the death of 
Noah Webster
 in 1843 to his 
An American Dictionary of the English Language
. This work had first been published in 1828 and was the first American unabridged dictionary. A second edition had been published in 1840, and subsequent editions were published by the company in 1847 and 1864. The 1890 revision was given the title 
Webster’s International Dictionary
 and was followed in 1909 by 
Webster’s New International Dictionary, Second Edition
, and in 1961 by 
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
.




Merriam-Webster dictionaries began to be published in electronic formats, including CD-ROMs and handheld devices, in the 1980s. In 1996 Merriam-Webster introduced Merriam-Webster OnLine, a 
Web site
 offering language-related features, including access to the full text of 
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary
 and 
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Thesaurus
. In 2002 
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
 was made available online at a subscription Web site.
