Really useful app. I have only one, but serious complaint: the reference hyperlinks in the results are large and very sensitive, and more often than a care for, while I am trying to scroll down, I touch a link which takes me to another result - another word. I use a Samsung Galaxy S22+. Not sure how, but please address.

It's a great dictionary but I can't change my Google account when I go to pay for ad free, it's trying to force an old account that only has a card that doesn't exist anymore, and won't let me pick my current email. The account it shows isn't even one I had on my phone at the time I downloaded! And then the contact us and feedback buttons don't do anything. Wouldn't be a big deal if ads weren't full screen and uncloseable. Have to close the whole app and reopen! Guess that's to force us to pay!

while the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is a powerful app for definitions and language reference on Android, it does not have a direct, system-integrated feature within the standard text selection menu like Google Translate's "Tap to Translate" for easy access within other apps. You would typically need to copy the text and then open or interact with the Merriam-Webster app separately. I selected a 2 star review so hopefully we can get this feature in future updates.
