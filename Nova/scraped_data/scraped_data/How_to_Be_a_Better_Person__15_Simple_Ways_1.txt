 Life can be a whirlwind of responsibilities and stress, but with the right focus, you can start becoming a better person and who you want to be. In this article, we’ll help you learn how to be a better person in a number of different ways. From honoring yourself to doing small acts of kindness, there’s something you can do each and every day to better yourself and grow as an individual. Keep reading to learn how you can embark on your self-improvement journey.





















Things You Should Know








Keep a gratitude journal to be more positive and compassionate.


Take care of your mental and physical health to brighten your mood and be happier.


Find healthier outlets for anger, like exercising and doing yoga, to redirect negative emotions.






















Steps










 
1






Set goals for yourself.






Download Article














Positive, obtainable aspirations can give you something to thrive for.
 Everyone needs something to live for, so think about what you want in life. Not only can striving for something make you a happier and better person, but it can also help you find your purpose. Use a pen and paper and write down the short and long-term goals you would like to achieve. Try asking yourself these questions to find and 
set an achievable goal
:
[1]


X


Research source












Is there a relationship in your life you want to improve?


What causes or movements are you passionate about?


Is there a project you’ve been meaning to finish?


What do you like to do in your free time?


Making your goal to “be a better” person may be challenging to define and achieve. Instead, opt for small goals that can help you grow as an individual, like reading a nonfiction book, writing a short story, calling your mom every weekend, or helping someone in need every day.

2






Practice forgiveness.






Download Article












Forgiving yourself
 and others can help you improve relationships.
 On your journey to becoming a better person, it’s important to let go of any grudges you're holding. The past is in the past; it’s time to move forward. Allow yourself time to forgive your past mistakes and recognize what they’ve taught you. Then, forgive those who have hurt you. You may not be able to forget what they’ve done, and that’s okay, but forgiveness can give you peace of mind.

Dwelling on past wrongs can actually increase your blood pressure and heart rate, while forgiveness can help manage and lower stress.




















 
3






Be empathetic towards others.






Download Article














Imagining what someone’s been through can give you a new perspective.
 Empathy is one of the first steps to being a better person because it builds your compassion. Not only does cultivating empathy help you be more sensitive toward other people, but it also helps you form lasting relationships and feel less isolated. 
Being empathic
 helps you gain a friend while challenging your perspective. Here are some ways you can 
be more empathic

Avoid making assumptions about people and jumping to conclusions.


Imagine yourself in someone else’s shoes or situation.




Actively listen
 to express interest and help someone feel heard.

Give back to your community.






Download Article












Helping others doesn’t only benefit them; it benefits you too!
 Research shows that being altruistic (the act of promoting someone else’s welfare) improves mood and overall happiness. So, 
consider volunteering
 at a local shelter, donating used clothes, or picking up trash at the park. Even the smallest act can make the biggest difference.

Aim to practice at least one act of kindness every day. It doesn’t have to be something big or time-consuming. Even leaving a sticky note on a public bathroom mirror saying, “You’re beautiful inside and out!” can make someone’s day.


When you help others, you get a rush of endorphins that make you feel good. This is known as the “helper’s high.”

Go outside your comfort zone.






Download Article














Expose yourself to new experiences to grow as an individual.
 Comfort zones are great, but they can also be stagnant. Every once and a while, change up your daily schedule, try something new, and 
step outside your comfort zone
. Trying new things that make you a little uncomfortable can broaden your horizons and open your eyes to a different perspective.
[5]


X


Research source














Make a bucket list
 of things you can do outside of your comfort zone. Then, spend every other weekend checking an activity off the list.


Ask friends to join you on your adventures for double the fun.


Experiment with a different routine by going to a different coffee shop for lunch or taking an alternative route to work.


Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. The impossible can be obtainable if you put your best foot forward.

6






Learn something new.






Download Article












One of the best ways to better yourself is to educate yourself.
 Knowledge can go a long way, especially when it comes to understanding other people’s situations. Whether you're in school or not, self-educating can help you grow and evolve as an individual. The more you know, the more perspective you’ll gain. Here are some ways you can learn something new today:
[6]


X


Research source












Sign up for a class you're interested in online or at a library. Maybe that’s an art class or a course on American Literature.


Read a nonfiction book.


Listen to a podcast about a topic you want to learn more about, like business, money, culture, or mental health.






















 
7






Acknowledge your weaknesses.






Download Article














Everyone has flaws, but you can aim to improve yours.
 Notice how your behavior and attitude affect others. Are people generally happy or sad around you? Do friends come to you for help or advice? Answering these questions and analyzing your interactions can help you discover and strengthen your weaknesses.
[7]


X


Research source












For instance, if friends don’t usually come to you for advice, ask yourself why. Do you talk over them or criticize their decisions? Maybe you need to work on being a better listener.


The more you learn to be flexible and adaptable with your behavior, the better you can care for yourself and those around you.

8






Control your anger.






Download Article












Feeling angry is natural, but too much anger can hinder compassion.
 When you want to be a better person, it’s important to understand the whys and hows of someone else’s situation. Things may not work out how they’re supposed to, but that's okay. Take a deep breath and remember that you may not be able to control many things, but you can control your attitude.

Try redirecting your anger away from yourself and others by going on a walk, doing yoga, or punching a pillow.



Calm yourself down by taking deep belly breaths and visualizing a relaxing or joyful memory.


Reconstruct your thinking patterns by avoiding words like “never” or “always” to describe yourself or others.

49%

 Instead, try journaling or taking deep breaths to calm yourself.






















 
9






Express your feelings respectfully.






Download Article














Using “I” statements can help you thoughtfully articulate emotions.
 Life is full of complex and confusing emotions, and with those emotions comes conflict. You may not be able to control every situation you’re in, but you can control your reactions. “I” statements can be used in conflicts or emotionally tense situations to communicate feelings without pointing blame. Check out these ways you can change these phrases into “I” statements:
[9]

Research source












“You never listen to me anymore,” changes to, “I feel that my concerns aren’t being heard.”


“I hate when you shout at the kids,” changes to, “When you shout at the kids, I feel upset because I want the kids to feel respected.”


“You’re always grounding me. It’s not fair!” changes to, “I feel like you’re always grounding me, and it upsets me.”

Be grateful.






Download Article












Practicing gratitude
 every day can help you be more positive.
 Gratitude is more than a feeling; it’s an active practice. Being thankful and appreciative of your life, no matter where you are in it, helps you be compassionate and loving towards yourself and others. Take a moment to recognize that goodness can be outside yourself and that every smile or simple favor is a gift.

Things don’t always happen the way you’d like them to, and that’s okay!
 Rather than getting upset when things don’t go your way, take a deep breath and remember to 
have patience
. It’s alright if life is slower. Try savoring these slow moments by noticing the little things and acknowledging the positives in the situation.

For instance, maybe you ordered a pizza for family game night, but the deliverer is stuck in traffic. Instead of getting frustrated, recognize that the extra time waiting for your pizza has given you more time to pick out a game. Plus, you’ll probably get a discounted pizza.


Another example could be that your computer starts updating the moment you want to work. Rather than getting upset, use the extra minutes of downtime to play with your dog, take a walk, or do some tidying up.

What qualities make up a good person?




















WikiLorisWatcher950






Okay listen, I know that no one is perfect, but there are definitely qualities that make someone a "good" or "decent" human. I like to think me and my friends fall under that category, but I'd love to hear what qualities other people think are important for being a good person too.


Read More






























Jeffrey Fermin


Employee Relations Expert
				
							
						




Some of the most important qualities I believe make a "good person" are:
• Self-awareness and Confidence: You know your worth, understand your strengths and weaknesses, and have a quiet confidence that isn't boastful.
• Integrity and Honesty: You stay true to your word, value trust, and always strive to act with honesty, even when it’s inconvenient or challenging.
• Ambition and Purpose: You're driven by a vision or purpose. You set goals for yourself and work diligently to achieve them.
• Emotional Intelligence: You have the ability to understand, express, and manage your own emotions, as well as empathize with others. You want to communicate and resolve conflicts directly.
• Respect for Others: You treat everyone around you with kindness and respect, no matter their background.
Embracing and cultivating these traits allows for personal growth and establishes a foundation for meaningful relationships and success in various life areas.

Chloe Carmichael, PhD

Since there is no such thing as a perfect person, a good person is able to be honest about their flaws and mistakes-- this is the only way we are able to be trustworthy and accountable to others and to keep growing. People who can't acknowledge their own mistakes tend to blame others for their problems and display immaturity in other areas as well. 
We can't improve what we won't acknowledge, so a good person must be able to be honest about areas for growth.

Tips from our Readers 




The advice in this section is based on the lived experiences of wikiHow readers like you. If you have a helpful tip you’d like to share on wikiHow, please submit it in the field below.




Remember that the journey of self improvement never ends. You won't eventually reach a place where you're suddenly "totally better" -- just try to be a little better every day.
					
					
				


If you haven't found your talent(s) yet, try to find out your family members' talents. Maybe they passed something down to you!
					
					
				


Be happy for others. You'll feel great and respect yourself more, and others will appreciate your good feelings towards them.
					
					
				


When you feel stressed out, take a deep breath and think about a way you can handle the situation before reacting.
					
					
				


Handle things with patience. Try putting yourself in the other person's shoes when you're dealing with someone.
					
					
				


Being happy rubs off on other people. Even if it's just acting, be happy and it will make others happier, too!
					
					
				


Respect works both ways. Respect others from the start and they'll respect you, too.
					
					
				


Choose good friends that accept you for who you are and support you.

Article Summary
X
If you want to be a better person, try to control your negative emotions, like anger and jealousy, since this will help you be more compassionate to others and to yourself. Try to empathize with people and imagine what it’s like to feel what they feel so you can be more sensitive to their emotions. For example, if someone is getting frustrated, try to imagine what thoughts and emotions they might be experiencing, so you can understand where they're coming from. Dwelling on the past can often bring you down, so try to forgive others when they make mistakes. For instance, if your boss is blunt with you, let it go, since they're probably under a lot of stress. You can also strive to do random acts of kindness every day, like holding the door open for someone, helping an elderly person carry their shopping, or paying for a stranger’s coffee.
