                            Rights-based arguments founder on the difficulties of transferring a general

                            Finally, it is in the interest of employees to have ethical care that respects them as persons - in the full

                            Nonetheless, it appears that 
moral
 orthodoxy, as defined by what the public is prepared to accept, is on the side of the animal experimentalists.

                            In the 
moral
 case, we can reasonably require agents to inquire into the nature of the situation when deciding what to do.

                            Feminist ethicists reject this stance and assert that

 philosophy has to pay attention to the psychological, social and political dimensions of life.
