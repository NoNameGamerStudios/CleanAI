How Morals Are Established

Morality vs. Ethics

Morality refers to the set of standards that enable people to live cooperatively in groups. It’s what societies determine to be “right” and “acceptable.”








 Sometimes, acting in a moral manner means individuals must sacrifice their own short-term interests to benefit society. Individuals who go against these standards may be considered immoral.





 It may be helpful to differentiate between related terms, such as 
immoral
, 
nonmoral
, and 
amoral
. Each has a slightly different meaning:






 
Immoral
: Describes someone who purposely commits an offensive act, even though they know the difference between what is right and wrong
Nonmoral
: Describes situations in which morality is not a concern
Amoral
: Describes someone who acknowledges the difference between right and wrong, but who is not concerned with morality






What Is Objective Morality?




 
 How Morals Are Established 
 


 Morality isn’t fixed. What’s considered acceptable in your culture might not be acceptable in another culture. Geographical regions, religion, family, and life experiences all influence morals. 





 Scholars don’t agree on exactly how morals are developed. However, there are several theories that have gained attention over the years:







Freud’s morality and the superego: 
Sigmund Freud
 suggested moral development occurred as a person’s ability to set aside their selfish needs (id) to be replaced by the values of important socializing agents, such as a person’s parents, teachers, and institutions (superego).


Piaget’s theory of moral development: 
Jean Piaget
 focused on the social-cognitive perspective of moral development. He theorized that moral development unfolds over time alongside the progressing stages of cognitive development. Early on, children learn to adopt certain moral behaviors for their own sake (it makes them feel good), rather than just abide by moral codes because they don’t want to get into trouble. By adolescence, you can think more abstractly, and begin to make moral decisions based on higher universal principles and the greater good of society.


B.F. Skinner’s behavioral theory: 
B.F. Skinner
 focused on the power of external forces that shaped an individual’s development. For example, a child who receives praise for being kind may treat someone with kindness again out of a desire to receive more positive attention in the future.


Kohlberg’s moral reasoning: 
Lawrence Kohlberg
 proposed six stages of moral development that went beyond Piaget’s theory. Through a series of questions or moral dilemmas, Kohlberg proposed that an adult’s stage of reasoning could be identified.


Gilligan's perspective of gender differences in moral reasoning
. 
Carol Gilligan
 criticized Kohlberg for being male-centric in his theory of moral development. She explained that men are more justice-oriented in their moral reasoning; whereas, women are more 
care-oriented
. Within that context, moral dilemmas will have different solutions depending on which gender is doing the reasoning.






What Is the Basis of Morality?


There are different theories as to how morals are developed. However, most theories acknowledge the external factors (parents, community, etc.) that contribute to a child's moral development. These morals are intended to benefit the group that has created them.


 
 Morals That Transcend Time and Culture 
 


 Most morals aren’t fixed. They usually shift and change over time.





 Ideas about whether certain behaviors are moral—such as engaging in pre-marital sex, entering into same-sex relationships, and using cannabis—have shifted over time. While the bulk of the population once viewed these behaviors as “wrong,” the vast majority of the population now finds these activities to be “acceptable.”





 In some regions, cultures, and religions, using contraception is considered immoral. In other parts of the world, some people consider contraception the moral thing to do, as it reduces unplanned pregnancy, manages the population, and reduces the risk of sexually transmitted illnesses.






7 Universal Morals


Some morals seem to transcend across the globe and across time, however. Researchers have discovered that these seven morals seem somewhat universal:
Be brave
Be fair
Defer to authority
Help your group
Love your family
Return favors
Respect others’ property


 
 Examples of Morals 
 


 The following are common morality examples that you may have been taught growing up, and may have even passed on to younger generations:







Be polite


Have 
empathy


Don't steal


Tell the 
truth


Treat others as you want to be treated






How Does the Golden Rule Apply to Social Media?




 People might adhere to these principles by:







Being an upstanding citizen


Doing volunteer work


Donating money to charity


Forgiving someone


Not gossiping about others


Offering their time and help to others






 To get a sense of the types of morality you were raised with, think about what your parents, community and/or religious leaders told you that you "should" or "ought" to do.









 
 Morality vs. Ethics 
 


 Some scholars don’t distinguish between 
morals and ethics
. Both have to do with “right and wrong.”






However, some people believe morality is personal while ethics refer to the standards of a community.


 For example, your community may not view premarital sex as a problem. But on a personal level, you might consider it immoral. By this definition, your morality would contradict the ethics of your community.






 
 Morality and Laws 
 


 Both laws and morals are meant to regulate behavior in a community to allow people to live in harmony. Both have firm foundations in the concept that everyone should have autonomy and show respect to one another.





 Legal thinkers interpret the relationship between laws and morality differently. Some argue that laws and morality are independent. This means that laws can’t be disregarded simply because they’re morally indefensible.






 Others believe law and morality are interdependent. These thinkers believe that laws that claim to regulate behavioral expectations must be in harmony with moral norms. Therefore, all laws must secure the welfare of the individual and be in place for the good of the community.





Something like adultery may be considered immoral by some, but it’s legal in most states. Additionally, it’s illegal to drive slightly over the speed limit but it isn’t necessarily considered immoral to do so.


 There may be times when some people argue that breaking the law is the “moral” thing to do. Stealing food to feed a starving person, for example, might be illegal but it also might be considered the “right thing” to do if it’s the only way to prevent someone from suffering or dying.





 
 Think About It 
 


 It can be helpful to spend some time thinking about the morals that guide your decisions about things like friendship, money, education, and family. Understanding what’s really important to you can help you understand yourself better and it may make difficult decisions easier.
