Did you know?








Ethics
 vs 
Morals
: Is there a difference?
 
Ethics
 and 
morals
 are both used in the plural and are often regarded as synonyms, but there is some distinction in how they are used. 


Morals
 often describes one's particular values concerning what is right and what is wrong: 




It would go against my 
morals
 to help you cheat on the test. 


He appears to view himself as a kind of culture warrior, striking out against the crumbling 
morals
 of modern society.
  
Jonathan Goldsbie, 
Now Toronto
, 16 Oct. 2014




While 
ethics
 can refer broadly to moral principles, one often sees it applied to questions of correct behavior within a relatively narrow area of activity:




Our class had a debate over the 
ethics
 of genetic testing. 


Anybody, it seemed, could make the music -- if they couldn't play guitar, they could push a button 
  -- and nobody worried about the 
ethics
 of appropriating riffs.
  
Jennifer Foote, 
Newsweek
, 23 July 1990




In addition, 
morals
 usually connotes an element of subjective preference, while 
ethics
 tends to suggest aspects of universal fairness and the question of whether or not an action is responsible:




Perhaps you don’t like Kim Kardashian, or her family, or her 
morals
 don’t align with yours, or you just think it’s weird that she might have had some plastic surgery, likes to apply makeup in a really complicated way and named her kid “Saint.”
  
Sarah Boboltz, 
The Huffington Post
, 12 Oct. 2016


The Frenches, both professors in The Media School, focused on the 
ethics
 of making medical decisions for a child who could not express her own wishes yet…
  
Chris Mura, 
Indiana Daily Student
, 18 Oct. 2016
