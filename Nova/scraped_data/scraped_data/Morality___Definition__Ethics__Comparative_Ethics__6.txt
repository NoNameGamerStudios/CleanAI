morality
,  the 
moral
 beliefs and practices of a 
culture
, 
community
, or 
religion
 or a code or system of moral rules, principles, or 
values
. The 
conceptual
 foundations and rational consistency of such standards are the subject matter of the philosophical 
discipline
 of 
ethics
, also known as moral 
philosophy
. In its contemporary usage, the term 
ethics
 is also applied to particular moral codes or systems and to the 
empirical
 study of their historical development and their social, economic, and 
geographic
 circumstances (
see
 
comparative ethics
).
(Read Peter Singer’s Britannica entry on ethics.)
Empirical studies show that all societies have moral rules that prescribe or forbid certain classes of action and that these rules are accompanied by sanctions to ensure their enforcement. It has been observed, for example, that virtually every society has well-established norms dealing with matters such as 
family
 organization and individual duties, 
sexual
 activity, 
property
 rights, personal welfare, 
truth
 telling, and promise keeping. Among all societies some moral rules are nearly universal—such as those forbidding 
murder
, 
theft
, infidelity or 
adultery
, and 
incest
—while others vary between societies or exist in some societies but not in others—such as those forbidding 
polygamy
, parricide, and feticide (
abortion
).

Christianity: Moral arguments






The existence of nearly universal moral rules has raised the question of whether such common practices are rooted in 
human nature
 and whether their 
commonality
 or naturalness renders them objectively valid in some sense. A related question is whether there exists a single, objectively valid moral code that is rationally discoverable even though it is not fully instantiated in the moral beliefs and practices of any society. In contrast, the 
diversity
 of moral rules between societies has raised the question of whether the validity of a moral rule is relative to the society in which it is recognized. Such questions are outside the scope of empirical studies of 
morality
 and properly within the domain of philosophical 
ethics
.

ethical relativism
