Did You Know?


“I have not that alacrity of spirit / Nor cheer of mind that I was 
wont
 to have,” says William Shakespeare’s King Richard III in 
the play that bears his name
. 
Alas
 and 
alack
, Richard! 
Alacrity
 comes from the Latin word 
alacer
, meaning “lively” or “eager,” and suggests physical quickness coupled with eagerness or enthusiasm. Thus, a spirit that lacks alacrity—like Richard III’s—is in the 
doldrums
, in need of a little (to use a much less formal word than 
alacrity
) 
get-up-and-go
.
