The 11th edition of 
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary


In 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, 
A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language
. The following year, in 1807, Webster began two consecutive decades of intensive work to expand his publication into a fully comprehensive dictionary, 
An American Dictionary of the English Language
. To help trace the etymology of words, Webster learned 26 languages. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the 
United States
 used somewhat different vocabularies and spelled, pronounced, and used words differently.

In 1825, while spending a year abroad at the 
University of Cambridge
 and then in Paris, Webster completed this dictionary, which featured 70,000 words, about 12,000 of which had never before appeared in a dictionary. A 
spelling reformer
, Webster believed that 
English
 spelling rules were unnecessarily complex and used the dictionary to introduce 
American English
 spellings, replacing 
colour
 with 
color
, 
waggon
 with 
wagon
, and 
centre
 with 
center
. He also added American words, including 
skunk
 and 
squash
, that did not appear in British dictionaries. Three years later, at age of 70 in 1828, Webster published the dictionary. But the dictionary proved a commercial disappointment, selling only 2,500 copies and leaving him in debt. In 1840, however, he released a second edition, which was published in two volumes and proved a vastly greater commercial success.

In 1843, following Webster's death, 
George Merriam
 and Charles Merriam secured publishing and revision rights to Webster's 1840 dictionary. Four years later, in 1847, they published a revised version of it, which did not change any of the main text but added new sections. In 1859, they published a second update with illustrations. In 1864, Merriam published a greatly expanded edition, which was the first version to change Webster's text, largely overhauling his work yet retaining many of his definitions and the title, 
An American Dictionary
. In 1884, the edition contained 118,000 words, "3000 more than any other English dictionary".

In 1890, they published a dictionary, which they retitled 
Webster's International
. The vocabulary was vastly expanded in 
Webster's New International
 editions published in  1909 and 1934, featuring over half a million words. Their 1934 edition was retrospectively called 
Webster's Second International
, or simply "The Second Edition" of the New International.

In 1898, 
Collegiate Dictionary
, now in its eleventh edition, was introduced. In 1890, following publication of 
Webster's International
. two 
Collegiate
 editions were issued as abridgments of each of their 
Unabridged
 editions. 



20th century






edit








Since the 1940s, the company has released several specialized dictionaries, language aides, and other references. In 1961, Merriam overhauled the dictionary again, publishing 
Webster's Third New International
, edited by 
Philip B. Gove
, whose revisions sparked public controversy. Many of the changes were in formatting, omitting needless 
punctuation
, or avoiding complete sentences when a phrase was sufficient. Others more controversial revisions signaled a shift from 
linguistic prescriptivism
 and towards 
describing
 American English as it was used at that time.

In 1964, the company became a subsidiary of 
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
.

In 1983, in the ninth edition of the 
Collegiate
 titled 
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary
 (WNNCD), the 
Collegiate
 adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the 
Third New International
, whose main text has remained virtually unrevised since 1961. Some proper names were returned to the word list, including names of 
Knights of the Round Table
. The most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word, to document its entry into 
English
. 

In 1983, after losing the right to exclusive use of the name Webster, its name was changed to Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, which was first reflected with publication of 
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary
. Previous publications used '
A Merriam-Webster Dictionary
 as a subtitle.



21st century






edit








In 2003, the eleventh edition of 
Collegiate
, was published, including over 225,000 definitions and more than 165,000 entries. A 
CD-ROM
 of the text is sometimes included. This dictionary is the preferred source "for general matters of spelling" by 
The Chicago Manual of Style
, which is followed by many U.S.-based book publishers and magazines. The 
Chicago Manual
 states that it "normally opts for" the first spelling listed.

The dictionary maintains an active social media presence, where it frequently posts dictionary-related content and its views on politics. Its 
Twitter
 account frequently used dictionary jargon to criticize and lampoon the 
Trump administration
.

 In November 2021, for instance, Merriam Webster subtly accused 
Kyle Rittenhouse
 of fake crying at his trial in a tweet that went viral.

Pronunciation guides






edit








Further information: 
Pronunciation respelling for English § Traditional respelling systems


The Merriam-Webster company once used a unique set of 
phonetic symbols
 in their dictionaries—intended to help people from different parts of the United States learn how to pronounce words the same way as others who spoke with the same accent or dialect did. 
Unicode
 accommodated 
IPA
 symbols from Unicode version 1.1 published in 1993, but did not support the phonetic symbols specific to Merriam-Webster dictionaries until Unicode version 4.0 published in 2003. Hence, to enable computerized access to the pronunciation without having to rework all dictionaries to IPA notation, the online services of Merriam-Webster specify phonetics using a less-specific set of 
ASCII
 characters.



Writing entries






edit








Merriam creates entries by finding uses of a particular word in print and recording them in a database of 
citations
.
[

]
 Editors at Merriam spend about an hour a day looking at print sources, from books and newspapers to less formal publications, like advertisements and product packaging, to study the uses of individual words and choose things that should be preserved in the citation file. Merriam-Webster's citation file contains more than 16 million entries documenting individual uses of words. Millions of these citations are recorded on 
3-by-5 cards
 in their paper citation files. The earliest entries in the paper citation files date back to the late 19th century. Since 2009, all new entries are recorded in an electronic database.
