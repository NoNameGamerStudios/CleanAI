# CleanAI

**DEPRECATED** 
 Just a lil' project im working on
---- I am coding -----

    This project is a simple thing for me to learn how to use python to make neural networks
**Inspired by neuro-sama AI**

    This was made by me (@Nonamegamerstudios) after i saw a dougdoug stream, and i've n been working on Nova AI ever since

**DISCLAIMER!!! THIS WAS MADE TO BE USED ON WINDOWS, (i'm okay with it being ported)**

    To install this 
        1. download the "Nova" directory for the main .py, data it's been trained on, and some basic prototypes of her code
            1b. (To get the simplest version without training data and logs, download nova lite)
        
        2.
